## Agile Iteration Burndown Chart

A project that uses a couple of JS libraries ([Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/)
 and [Morris.js](http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/)) to render a nice SVG burndown chart for Agile iterations.

Ideally the data it uses could be provided via an API, but for now it reads an HTML table that has daily totals of remaining story points.

### Demo
This branch currently has a demo that can be run as a [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.8.3/YoungElPaso/Burndown-Chart/tree/master/demo), taking advantage of an interesting feature in jsFiddle that [allows you to run code from GitHub](http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/github_read.html).
